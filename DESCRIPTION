Description: Designed to replace the tables which were in the back of the first two editions of Hollander and Wolfe - Nonparametric Statistical Methods.  Exact procedures are performed when computationally possible.  Monte Carlo and Asymptotic procedures are performed otherwise.  For those procedures included in the base packages, our code simply provides a wrapper to standardize the output with the other procedures in the package.
